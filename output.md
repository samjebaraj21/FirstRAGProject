# Financial Fables About the Stock Market...

1. “You Must Buy & Hold!”
2. “You Can’t Know When to Buy & Sell!”
3. “You Must Diversify!”

They overemphasize the importance of “Buy & Hold” leading you to believe that you “Cannot Know When to Buy and Sell.”

Let’s take a look at each of these Financial Fables, and break them down so that we know WHY they could be very misleading!

## 1. “You Must Buy & Hold!”

The people your financial advisor works for don’t “Buy & Hold”! They trade stocks!

When asked: “Do you trade stocks?” Stock Market Wizards always say, “Yes—sometimes twice in the same day.... Usually every few weeks.”
—Stuart Walton, Stock Market Wizards (115% avg. over 8 yrs)

While they’re telling you, “You must buy and hold blue chip stocks to make money safely...”, they earn 100+% off your money and pay you 8%![^1]

Ask your financial advisor what the phrase “Window Dressing” means. Mutual Funds sell their growth stocks, and buy blue chips at the end of the year to “dress up” their SEC reports!

You thought they were holding blue chips, because that’s what showed up in the

[^1]: How Investors Lose 89 Percent of Gains from Futures Funds, by David Evans, Bloomberg 10/08/13


10

prospects! All year long, they were ACTIVELY TRADING growth stocks!²

In 2002, the great stock trader and editor of the Investor’s Business Daily, William O’Neil said, “Since the 1950s, the average market leader has fallen 72% from its high. In the 1990s many fell 90%, and only one in eight ever reassert themselves as leaders. In 1964 AT&T fell from $75, and it took twenty years to come back.”³ In 2000, many Tech stocks fell 75% to 90% and some will never recover.⁴

Perhaps you were one of the 80 million Americans who lost 50% to 80% of their life’s savings because their money managers refused to cut losses.⁵ If so, you understand that “Buy & Hold” is not always a great idea. In my experience, there are times in a market cycle when it could be, and times when shorter term trades would be more appropriate.

## The Danger of Buy & Hold

“The NASDAQ is trading at its highest level in over a decade and is up more than 1,000 points in the past year.

“If it can eke out another 1,000 points, or rally 25% from here, it will have retraced all its losses from the dot-com bubble and trade above 5,000.

“That means it will have taken over 13 years!”⁶

Scott Burns, a regular syndicated writer in the Financial Section of the Dallas Morning News, wrote the following in November of 2008:

“Have you dared to look at your 401(k) statement lately? ...The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results. So I’d like to offer an early New Year’s resolution. Demonstrate your sanity. Give your overpaid managers the boot.”

# 2. “You Can’t Know When to Buy or Sell!”

“The idea that one cannot time the market is a **myth.**” —William O’Neal

O’Neil says, “The erroneous belief that no one can time the market evolved more than 30 years ago when most mutual funds that tried it **weren’t successful at it.** This is because they had to both sell **exactly right** and then get back in the market at exactly the right time, but due to their **asset size problems,** it took **two weeks to raise cash** and weeks to reenter the market.... Therefore top management at these mutual funds imposed rules on their money managers that required them to remain **fully invested.**”<sup>7</sup>

Beyond 30 years ago, short-term trading was very much in vogue, and David Mitchell’s grandfather certainly did not ever think that all money should be tied up in long-term buy and hold positions, so he was in agreement with O’Neil.

### Who is William O’Neil?

William O’Neil owns a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, which he bought with money he earned trading between 1962 and 1963, starting with $4,000 from his salary. During this time he was in his twenties, and invested in just three companies.

# 3. "You MUST Diversify!"

> “They greatly overemphasize the importance of diversification and OVER-diversify. Actually, the need for great diversification is also a myth.”  
> — David Mitchell

- ▶️ Mutual Funds
- ▶️ Annuities
- ▶️ Life Insurance

The fear of risk is used to frighten you away from the market. They do this because Financial Advisors make a living by selling you products!

Without skill-sets, these are necessary. When you have skill-sets, it changes EVERYTHING!

> “Diversification is something people do to protect themselves from their own stupidity.”<sup>8</sup> — Warren Buffet

Philip Fisher, legendary stock trader from California, stated that diversification was an idea that caught on "...Because it was a simple enough theory for even stock brokers to understand."<sup>9</sup>

# 2 Types of Investors

## Traditional Investor
**Buy & Hold Mindset**
- Ignorant of disciplines of trading
- Passive
- Relies on Financial Advisor
- No Cash Now!

## Stock Trader w/o Skills
**Cashflow Mindset**
- Ignorant of disciplines of trading
- More active but fearful & greedy!
- Too much or too little risk = Failure!

## Value Investors
- Too focused on PE Ratio
- Buys bad stocks because they're cheap
- Skip good stocks because they cost more

## Growth Investors
- Focus on EPS
- Need to be aware of proper entry & exit

----

We believe investing is for people who want to maintain their wealth and attempt to grow it slowly.

**Why I don’t ONLY like to invest:**

Typically, investing does NOT create wealth. Trading has the potential to create wealth and cash flow for families! These skill-sets are totally different...

# The Result of the Three-Legged Table

**Get the math on your side!**
- Win BIG using predetermined sell points.
- Lose LITTLE using stop outs.

**Leverage the Big Boys!**
- Use charting software (David Mitchell uses Charts by TRADEway).
- Get in right after the Big Boys.
- Get out right before the Big Boys.

# Should We Trade ETFs?

Exchange-Traded Fund Definition (ETF): “A security that tracks an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold.”

We do not recommend trading ETFs because one of the three legs of the trading table will always be missing. ETFs, like indices, do not have fundamentals. These may be vehicles that can be used for long-term investing, but not trading, in our opinion.

# Basic Stock Market Jargon

## What You Need to Know:

- **Major Exchanges**—warehouses for stocks

  **NASDAQ  NYSE  AMEX**

- **Market Makers**

  Each company will have 10 to 30 Market Makers. One Market Maker will handle 400 to 500 different companies. They make a market in the stock. This is not a "zero sum game." You buy from and sell to the Market Maker—you cannot hurt him!

  Market Makers are wholesalers of stocks—some call them **thieves!**

### The BID and the ASK — Their profit is between here.

- **Bid = $23.50**
- **Ask = $23.75**
- **Spread = $0.25**

How do you know what you buy and sell for? It’s the price that you **DO NOT want** (i.e. you would **buy for $23.75/share and sell for $23.50/share**).

# Market Tone

1. World News; it takes a decade or more to master it!

2. Charting the S&P 500; we’ll teach you proper charting techniques in this course!

## Squirrel Market©

When either (1.) the S&P 500 chart breaks out either up through resistance or down through support (the pattern has changed); or (2.) the news component of Market Tone does not match the S&P 500 chart component.

Usually at this point we will put out a “Squirrel Market Alert,” which means the Mitchell family and staff are NOT trading regular strategies from courses 1-3. Therefore, the TRADEway system suggests not trading for newer students with little experience, during a Squirrel Market Alert. These last, on average, 6 to 8 weeks or less.

## Amateur Hour

This is the first hour of the trading day.

- Usually amateurs place a trade, then run off to work.
- Many times amateurs get it wrong.
- Professionals know this and often don’t trade immediately.
- The market can reverse directions any time of the day and sometimes does so immediately after Amateur Hour.

Due to this instability, it is not a wise time for novice traders to initiate trades. Rather, one may watch to see what the **professionals do AFTER amateur hour**, then place one’s trade.

It Will Be a Rolling Stock or a Down Trending Stock.

If a Down Trending Stock Breaks the Resistance Line...

It is now a Rolling Stock or an Up Trending Stock.

# Chart Description

The chart shows a price breakout with a decrease in volume, suggesting the need to watch for anomalies.



![Chart showing market trends and anomalies](chart)

**Up is good! Down is good! Let the market tell you what it is doing!**

### PIVOT POINTS

When a stock bounces up or down off of a Support or Resistance line.

### OUTRIDER ANOMALIES

These are drastically higher or lower price points that fall outside the normal Support and Resistance lines for approximately one or two days. Don’t count these when drawing Support and Resistance lines.

Stochastics: Rolling Stocks

![Chart showing stock price movements with stochastic indicators. Key points marked as "Sell", "Buy", and "Tells Nothing".]

**Settings:** 13—5—7 (Exponential)  
Exponential provides quicker Buy & Sell signals than 14—7—9.

**Function:** Buy & Sell signals. The stock must be in a rolling pattern for 3 weeks or more, or it’s not a good indicator.

**Method:** When lines cross, separate, and turn above or below the lines, it indicates a buy or sell signal. If between the 80% & 20% lines, it tells us nothing!

![Chart of EMAs: Trending Stocks](chart_image)

**Moving Averages**

- **10 Day** (Red Line)
- **20 Day** (White Line)
- **50 Day** (Blue Line)

**Settings:** 10—20—50 (days); Exponential

**Function:** Find Buy Points; NOT for a Rolling Stock—must have a trend up or down.

**Method:** Determine which line the stock bounces off of. It tends to continue to do so. So few stocks bounce off the 10-day that I believe it is unreliable, so I always look for stocks bouncing off the 20 or 50-day M.A.

# Why Charting Works...  
## Human psychology is behind

- **BIG BOYS with the BIG MONEY control the pivot points.**

- **There is a NUMBER ONE. OTHER BIG MONEY MANAGERS must join in, or the No. 1 may not be able to control the direction.**

- **Usually they join in because it is mutually beneficial**

- **This is HOW IT WORKS....**

### Chart Description

- **Historic Horizontal Price Lines**: These lines represent key levels where the price has historically reacted.

- **Supply**: 
  - **+3 Million Shares**

- **Illustration**: 
  - Three figures labeled #1, #2, and #3, representing big money managers.

### Process Explanation

- As the stock nears the resistance line:
  - **#1 sells 1M shares and shorts 1M.**
  - **#2 & #3 sell 250K shares each and short 250K each.**

- **Outcome**: 
  - 3 million shares hit the market, increasing supply and driving the price down.

### Volume and Patterns

Certain patterns require high volume on the day of the move in order to signal that one should get in the play, but not all patterns require this (such as rolling, stairs, flags, and normal trends).

However, if any pattern includes higher volume than the day before when the up move takes place, this is even better evidence that the play has potential to work.

### Buying Strategy

- Buy as **NEAR** the pivot point as possible.
- This is an **ART** more than a science.
- Don’t use a percentage.
- Just “eyeball” it...
  - ...if it looks too far from the pivot point (support or resistance line)
  - ...then **DON’T** buy it!!!

### Chart Explanation

- **Pivot Point**: Key level for buying.
- **Resistance**: Upper boundary.
- **Support**: Lower boundary.
- **Breakouts**: Indicate potential upward trends.
- **Anomalies**: Deviations from expected patterns.
- **Trend**: Upward movement "through the roof"!


Buy at the right place!

![Chart Description](chart)

- **Pivot Point**: Buy point near a CLEAR pivot point.
- **Buy? YES!**: Indicates the optimal buying point.
- **Buy? No!**: Warning against buying at or near the top.
- **Don't get caught buying at or near the top!**

# Pull Back:
Within the normal move from Support and Resistance lines, after a few days up, there is normally a pull back (down). Stocks seldom move straight up, they “zig zag” up. These pull back days are often small dark candlesticks on low volume.

# Retracement:
Once a stock hits Resistance, it normally moves back down to Support, and bounces back up. This is natural. It does not mean the stock is weak. Normally, this is profit taking, but Bulls are anxious to buy again at Support.

# Correction:
A “Correction” is when a stock moves down THROUGH the Support line on higher volume and continues down from there (or up through Resistance). At this point, the pattern has changed.

On the S&P 500, this is a larger move down, but not the end of the Bull. This can mark the beginning of a “Squirrel Market.”©

1. **Fundamentals**: Shows you *what* to buy. Includes earnings per share, relative price strength, industry group ratings, return on equity and accumulation/distribution. It determines if the company’s financial statements are in order through ratios such as the ones listed previously. Trade in stocks that are good, strong, and sound companies with good to great financial statements. This helps to determine which stocks you should look at buying.

2. **Technicals**: Shows you *when* to buy and sell your fundamentally sound stock. It uses charts to measure price and strength movements over time, which helps determine buy and sell points. It measures the emotions of the market and graphically displays supply and demand for the stock. It includes chart price movements, chart volume movements, signature patterns, candlesticks, gaps and secondary indicators.

3. **Market Tone**: Shows you *why* to buy now or not to buy now. Market Tone consists of two parts: charting the S&P 500 and the world news. Part of Market Tone is the Technical Analysis of the S&P 500 index. The other part is determined by the world news. It takes years to develop and understand which world news is driving the market. The news and events that are important for individual stocks include earnings announcements, mergers, spin offs, stock splits, share buy backs, lawsuits, upgrades, downgrades, new products and other company news.

## Basic Stock Market Jargon:

**Buy Point**: The point of purchase after the stock bounces up off of Support.

**Candlesticks**: These are turn indicators. Each candlestick is a visual representation of the opening and closing price of a stock for the time period set on the chart; daily, weekly, monthly, etc. This term gets its name because it looks like a candlestick that has a wick on both ends. A clear candlestick represents a stock which opened at a certain price and closed at a higher price. A dark candlestick represents a stock which opened at a certain price and closed at a lower price.

Day Order: Good for calendar day only (this order will cancel at the close of the market unless it was already executed or filled).

Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF): A security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold. We do not recommend trading ETFs because one of the three legs of the trading table will always be missing. ETFs, like indices, do not have fundamentals. These may be vehicles that can be used for long-term investing, but not trading.

Executed or Filled Order: Order was placed and executed; you now own the stock or you have sold the stock.

GTC: Good till canceled (this type of order will be an open order until it is either executed or canceled).

Market Makers: Found on the NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX stock exchanges. A company will have 10 to 30 Market Makers and one will handle 400 to 500 different companies.

Market Order: Buying or selling at the current market price. This often changes or can be manipulated by the Market Maker. The appropriate time to use this would be when you must get in or out of a position in a hurry (i.e. the market is rapidly going up or down).

OCO: One cancels the other.

Open Order: Order has been placed, but not yet executed (you do not own the stock or have not yet sold the stock).

Outrider Anomalies: Drastically higher or lower price points that fall outside the normal Resistance and Support lines for approximately one or two days. Do not count these when drawing Resistance and Support lines.

Price Graph: A chart which shows the price of a stock and its movement over time. The price of the stock is indicated on the right side of the graph.

Pivot Points: When a stock bounces up or down off of a Support or Resistance line.

**Primary Indicators:** Price Graph Patterns, Support and Resistance lines, Volume Bars and Candlesticks are the primary indicators that show buy and sell points.

**Resistance Line:** The top line drawn to show historically where the stock moves up before bouncing and moving down to Support.

**ROI:** Cash-In divided by Cash-Out (of pocket) = ROI% over time—OR—Profit/Initial Investment = ROI%.

**ROI Annualized:** (See page 36 of workbook)

**Rolling Stock:** A stock which continually rolls between two price points—a high and a low. This is also called a consolidation, channeling or sideways stock.

**Secondary Indicators:** Use these indicators to help confirm your decision to buy or sell based on your primary indicators. Secondary indicators are used in Technical analysis to anticipate changes in stock trends or price patterns. Secondary indicators discussed in “Step 1: Start Your Journey” include: Stochastics (F3) and Exponential Moving Averages (F6).

**Sell Point:** The point just before the stock reaches the Resistance line.

**Stops:** A stop order allows you to stop out of a play when the stock is moving against you.

**Stop Limit:** Becomes an active Limit Order at a specified price. **WARNING:** Might not get filled if the stock gaps below your stop price.

**Stop Loss or Stop Market:** This becomes an active Market Order at a specified price. This type of stop will stop you out of your play at the price you entered or anything below that price. You could set the stop on the stock price, 8% below your buy point.

**Support Line:** The bottom line drawn to show historically where the stock moves up to before bouncing and moving up to Resistance.

**Trailing Stop:** A trailing stop is designed to protect gains by enabling a trade to remain open and continue to profit as long as the price is moving in the right direction.

direction, but closing the trade if the price changes direction by a specified percentage or dollar/cent amount. You could use a trailing stop when your stock reaches your predetermined sell point, placing a tight trailing stop a little below the bid. If your brokerage house doesn't offer trailing stops, you could accomplish the same thing with stop alerts on your smartphone. When the alert goes off, then you would have to manually sell your stock.

**Trending Stock:** A stock which continually moves between Support and Resistance lines. 1. Up Trend; 2. Down Trend.

**Volume Bars:** Indicates the number of shares of stock bought and sold each day. (Note: With TC2000 v.7, add 2 zeroes to the volume noted on the top of the screen because 2 zeroes have been truncated). They must be 300,000+ shares traded on average per day.

### Basic Guidelines for Using David Mitchell’s System:

1. Know your exit point before entering a trade.
2. Don’t get greedy!
3. Use stop losses or alarms.
4. Don’t respond to fear!
5. Be patient.
6. Average Volume should be over 300,000+ shares per day.
7. Stock should be $10 - $30 in value (low-priced).
8. Don’t buy stocks going down! Wait for the stock to bounce and go up.
9. Check earnings reports and sell the day before they come out. It is your responsibility to know the dates when checking the news and events of your stock.
10. Ask, is it...“predictable, repeatable and reliable?”

### Strive Your Best To:

1. Recognize patterns. (If you don’t see a pattern, don’t trade it.)
2. Use correct buy points.
3. If the pattern changes, get out. (No longer predictable, repeatable, or reliable).
