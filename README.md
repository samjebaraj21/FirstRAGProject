# Description of Project

This project is my introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation. 
It includes all important components: Splitting the input data into chunks, connecting with the Llama3.2 LLM, retrieving from Pinecone's Vector DB, and producing the output after providing a query. 
This is all done using the LangChain framework, with a planned expansion into LangGraph for Agentic RAG and DeepEval.
The PDF that is used for retrieval is a basic stock trading PDF that was on my personal machine.
